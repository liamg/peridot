Peridot is a CLI utility that provides user environment management for Linux/OSX. Think Terraform for your dotfiles and local setup that can be applied across your machines, regardless of differences in distro, window manager etc.

Templating functions can be used in all config files managed by peridot, to apply different settings based on the Linux distribution and other factors. All settings can be overriden with local config files.

If you struggle with maintaining your dotfiles in one big git repository and/or sharing them across multiple machines, Peridot is for you.

Check out the [getting started guide](guide), or see a [real example](https://github.com/liamg/peridot-config) of peridot-managed dotfiles.
