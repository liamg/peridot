Peridot is a CLI utility that provides user environment management for Linux/OSX. Think Terraform for your dotfiles and local setup that can be replicated across your machines, regardless of differences in distro, window manager etc.

If you struggle with maintaining your dotfiles in one big git repository and/or sharing them across multiple machines, Peridot is for you.
